I take immense pride in introducing my student Rutik, He has pursued his engineering course under our University 
and hence I consider myself to be pivotally placed to judge his aptitude and caliber. I have taught him Operating 
systems, Engineering Subjects. His interest in the field of Computer Science, I feel, makes him an ideal student
for higher education in this field.
He is a very good student with extraordinary grasping ability which helps him understand even the intricate details
very easily. His ability to handle pressure situations and come on top is extremely commendable. His never-ending
quench for knowledge and ability to reason has impressed me the most. This attitude of his, I am sure, will help
him go a long way in this field. His obedience and punctuality are other two exceptional qualities which make him
an ideal student. He is also a diligent and industrious person.

His strong points also include good communication skills. I stand as a guarantee for his expertise and comprehension
in the above mentioned subjects. His competence and efficiency is proved by his academic activities and I can rate
him to be among the top 5% of the students I have taught. Before I conclude, I would like to say that Rutik is an
excellent choice for a this program and will always work towards the success of the course. Thus I strongly
recommend him for an M.S. student, in your university.
